# Metamorphic

# Introduction
This project represents an advanced iteration of the original metamorphic technique developed by @FlareCoding. With a focus on extending compatibility to 64-bit architectures and enhancing overall performance and security, this upgrade introduces a suite of optimizations and new features designed to meet modern computing challenges.

# Acknowledgements
We extend our deepest gratitude to @FlareCoding for the original https://github.com/FlareCoding. This work serves as the foundation upon which we've built our enhancements, and without it, our advancements would not have been possible.

# Enhancements
64-bit Compatibility
Upgraded the core engine to fully support 64-bit architectures, ensuring improved performance on modern hardware.

Enhanced Mutation Instructions
Introduced optimized 2-op and 3-op instructions tailored for 64-bit processing, enhancing the obfuscation capabilities.

Advanced Memory Management
Implemented dynamic memory allocation techniques using VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect to enhance execution safety and efficiency.

# Security Amplification
Leveraged the security features inherent to 64-bit architectures, such as enhanced ASLR, to fortify against reverse engineering.

# Codebase Optimization
Conducted a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase, adopting modern C++ standards for better readability, maintainability, and performance.
